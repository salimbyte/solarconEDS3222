This project is a website for a solar installation consultancy, designed to be both professional and user-friendly. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I implemented a responsive layout with features like an image gallery, a slideshow, and a JavaScript-based navigation toggle. Stock images and icons sourced from platforms like Pexels and Flaticon were used to add quality visuals.

Key Features
    Responsive Design across all devices
    Dynamic Slideshow for showcasing images
    Contact Form for user inquiries
    Resources
I used W3Schools for guidance on CSS grid and JavaScript interactivity, along with Google Fonts and Flaticon for added design elements.
